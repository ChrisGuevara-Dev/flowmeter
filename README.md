# Flowmeter
The project focuses on developing a flow control system using a YF-S201 flow sensor and an electrovalve, both managed by an Atmega328P microcontroller. Through electronic design in KiCAD, precise arrangement of components and connections, as well as an optimal configuration of the printed circuit board (PCB) are planned. The primary focus of the project is to monitor and control the flow, with potential applications in irrigation systems.
